# TravellingSalesman

Advanced Computational Physics project. Program allows examining the travelling salseman problem, various methods of solving it with different parametrs, and comparing the different methods. Am image is loaded in the program and nodes can be placed on the image and edited. An example with the US map is provided. The method to solve can be chosen and the results shown on the screen. Some graphs of different methods are included in the /figures directory
